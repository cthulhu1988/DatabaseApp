# DatabaseApp

This application has been successfully run on Ubuntu 20.04 but
should work on any Linux/Unix based system.
The program is coded to work with Python 3, not Python 2. In
Ubuntu the following command needs to be used to use Tkinter:

apt-get install python3-tk
This command assumes a Debian based operating system. Otherwise check your
package manager with regards to Tkinter

This will allow the GUI to work properly.
Atom was used for coding the application but no specific IDE is necessary to
compile and run the application.


The following must be at the beginning of hw5.py assuming your python 3 install
is also installed in /usr/bin:

!/usr/bin/python3

In the directory, type ./hw5.py to run. 

Otherwise, remove that line and run the program using

python3 hw5.py
